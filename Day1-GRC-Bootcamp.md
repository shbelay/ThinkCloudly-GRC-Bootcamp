## Deep Dive into GRC Concepts

### Governance
Governance refers to the frameworks, policies, and decision-making structures that ensure IT aligns with business goals and adheres to legal and organizational standards.

### Risk Management
Risk management includes the processes of identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats to systems, infrastructure, data, and operations. This is a proactive discipline essential for business continuity.

### Compliance
Compliance ensures conformity to internal policies, regulatory laws, and industry-specific standards. Non-compliance can lead to fines, loss of trust, and legal actions.

## Role of IT Auditing in GRC

IT auditing helps identify control gaps, ensure compliance, and improve the organization's security and operational resilience. It plays a central role in validating that GRC processes are not only designed but also functioning as intended.

Common IT audit activities include:
- Evaluation of IT controls
- Identification of system/process gaps
- Verification of compliance to frameworks
- Recommending remediation measures
